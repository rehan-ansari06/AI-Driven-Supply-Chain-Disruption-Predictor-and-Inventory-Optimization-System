# AI-Driven-Supply-Chain-Disruption-Predictor-and-Inventory-Optimization-System
My first Project of AI and ML
Goals: Leverage AI and machine learning to address challenges in supply chain management, including disruptions and inefficiencies.Use global supply chain data and predictive analytics to anticipate risks before they impact operations.Dynamically adjust inventory levels to mitigate risks and ensure continuity of operations.Ensure stakeholders and warehouse owner's receive timely information about potential disruptions and necessary adjustments.

The objective is to utilize natural language processing (NLP) via large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI GPT to analyze diverse data sources such as news,supplier updates,and transportation trends.

Milestone 1:

To gather data from different data sources related to global supply chain.
Setting up the environments,tools and libraries for project infrastructure.
Researching on which pre created LLM models to use in project for predicting and NLP tasks.

Expected Outcomes
Enhanced ability to anticipate and manage supply chain disruptions.
Optimized inventory levels to balance cost and risk.
Reduced losses and increased operational resilience.
